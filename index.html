        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>Use <b>WSAD</b> or <b>←↕→</b> to move, you can also use <b>Space/W/↑</b> to jump.
            You can reset checkpoints <i>(activated if steped on green pipes)</i> using <b>U</b> while playing.</p>
        <p>It is possible to walk on brick blocks and green pipes. You can also use the ladders to climb.
            Magnets will hold onto you. You can use <b>S</b> to let go or <b>Space/W/↑</b> to jump once on the side. 
            You can also move on magnets.
        </p>
        <p>Spiders, dragons and spikes will kill you if once colide with them.</p>
        <p>Every 10 seconds a dragon will spawn. A countdown will help you to know when he is coming.
            Dragons always spawn on the same height level as you so KEEP MOVING.</p>
