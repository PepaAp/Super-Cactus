Super Cactus Bros
Super Cactus Bros is a 2d game ispired by Super Mario Bros. The whole game is made in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is a project started for learning JS and became a part of my school halfyear project.

Controls
To move you can use WSAD, arrowkeys and space for jumping. 
U can be used to reset previous checkpoints. Acts like a reset for the game. Each checkpoint is stored locally.
W/↑/space can be used on a ladder to go up.
S/↓ can be used to go down on a ladder.
W/↑/space while on a magnet can be used to jump if on the corner.
S/↓ while on a magnet can be used to let go.

Blocks
Wall - walls can be used like piece of ground. You can walk on them and jump from them.
Pipe - pipes are functioning like a checkpoints. If you get on top of a pipe a message will inform you that a checkpoint has been created. Once you die you will respawn on top of the pipe.
Ladder - ladders are just ladders. You can go up and down.
Magnet - magnet will hold on to you and wont let go. To let go you can either press S/↓ to fall, press W/↑/space to jump while on the corner or just go out of the range to fall.
Spikes - spikes will kill you instantly if you touch them.

Entities
Spider - spiders move from side to side. Unlike in Mario you can´t kill them. If you touch a spider you will die.
Dragon - dragons spawn every dedicated amount of time. Spawnpoint of a dragon is on the right side of the game screen at the same y level as the player. Once spawned they fly in the same y level as they spawned in. A timer and a sound will help you to know when he is going to spawn. If you collide with a dragon you die.
